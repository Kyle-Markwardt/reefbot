# ReefBot (BRSai)

### LLM trained on years of BRStv Youtube videos to provide the most accurate and current reef aquarium answers
The goal is to have a chatbot aggregate the accumulated knowledge produced and/or published by BRStv over years and make it readily accessible to users, without having to search through years of video. 

Steps:
1. Create transcripts of key BRStv video series:
   - 52 Weeks of Reefing
   - 52 FAQ
   - 52 Weeks of Reefing Second Edition
   - Interviews
   - MACNA
   - Biome Cycling
   - Nutrients
   - Maybe: BRS Investigates (quantitative videos)
   - Possibly Non-BRS sources
2. Train LLM on these transcripts.
3. Create chatbot that provides helpful reef hobby answers on chemistry, lighting, nutrients, flow, livestock, cycling, scaping, etc.
